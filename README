The parallel version of the drop detector part of the linescan application by CUDA.


src/                           the source directory
drop_detector.cu               the entry point and main file of the application
drop_detector_cpu.cpp          the reference serial implementation
drop_detector_v1.cu            each nozzle associated with a CUDA block
drop_detector_v2.cu            each nozzle associated with a CUDA block and CUDA
                               threads parallelize operations within each blocks
drop_detector_v3.cu            parallel version of v2 plus use of shared memory
                               when possible

inputs/                        directory for the input files
                               each input data set contains 4 files

file_io.cpp                    functions for reading the inputs from the files
globals.hpp                    global definitions
results.txt                    contains examples of execution results

Notes:
- For each data set, the macro definitions N and BUFFER_SIZE should be adjusted
in the globals.hpp file accordingly.
